Starting, sustaining, and assessing partnership-driven health programming at your library, Kernel of Knowledge",https://youtu.be/bbcNuOAb2_8,"The U.S Institute of Museum and Library Services recently challenged museums and libraries to transform how they collaborate with their communities. This webinar focuses on how pubic libraries answer this call to action by partnering with institutions, groups, and individuals in their communities to offer high-impact health programming. Based on research conducted as part of Let's Move in Libraries (2), his ongoing blog series published by the ALA Public Programs Office on partnership-driven health programming (3) , and as part of a new project focused on how libraries contribute to food justice, Dr. Lenstra will provide on overview of strategies and tactics libraries use to start, sustain, and assess partnership-driven health programming. Particular attention will be given to small and rural libraries. Topics to be covered include: Finding the time to partner, identifying partners, joining community coalitions & task-forces, and leveraging partnerships to secure external funding and resources for your library. These topics will be illustrated through in-depth examples of actual public libraries from across the country engaged in ongoing partnership-driven health programming.   Bio: Dr. Noah Lenstra, MLIS is an assistant professor of Library and Information Studies at the University of North Carolina Greensboro, and the founder and director of Let's Move in Libraries, an international initiative to get people of all ages and abilities moving through public libraries. He was a member of the PLA Promoting Healthy Communities Advisory Group (2017-2018). His research on these topics has been published in Library Quarterly, Evidence Based Library and Information Practice, Journal of Library Administration, Advances in Library Administration and Organization and Public Library Quarterly. He has presented on increasing physical activity through libraries at the Association for Rural and Small Libraries (ARSL), the Association for Library Services to Children (ALSC), the North Carolina Library Association (NCLA), the Azalea Coast Library Association, the Atlantic Provinces Library Association, and at the Nebraska State Library's Big Talk from Small Libraries online conference. He received his PhD in Library and Information Science in 2016 from the University of Illinois. He wrote the Forward for the recently published (May 2018) handbook Get Your Community Moving: Physical Literacy Programs for All Ages, written by library director Jenn Carson, and published by ALA Editions.

This webinar introduces the WikiCite initiative to build a database of open citations to support free and computational access to bibliographic metadata and will identify simple, high impact ways for to get involved. As experts in the intersection of bibliographic metadata, information discovery, and interdisciplinary research, librarians are a tremendous resource for this community. Currently the WikiCite citation database is being developed in Wikidata, which has also become a viable linked data hub for library collections and authority data. Citations are vital to Wikipedia's foundation of verifiability, not truth, and academic libraries are uniquely positioned to connect researchers and their outputs with the wider information ecosystem. As the backbone of scholarly knowledge, citations are also vital components of Open Science RDM strategies. Open, structured, separable citations encourage data reuse and remixing to reproduce, verify, and build on results reported in scholarly literature. In addition to access, Wikidata adds these citations to the linked data knowledge graph, supporting applications like Scholia (https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/) that generate scholarly profiles and Wikidata info cards that can be added to library systems (https://gitlab.com/denials/wikidata-music-infocard).",false,MP4 Video,YouTube Video,60,Data Science,Network of the National Library of Medicine,User; Trainer,06/12/2020 12:00:00 AM,12/07/2018 12:00:00 AM
